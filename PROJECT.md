Capstone Project with To Your Health Bakery

# Project Proposal

## Overview

To Your Health Bakery is a family-owned local business owned by mother and daughter:
Anna and Kalliope. The company focuses on specialization in baked
goods that are gluten-free, vegan, and allergy-free pastries. The company also provides a variety
of products that are keto and paleo-friendly as well.

To Your Health Bakery provides a variety of sweet baked products: the sweet treats of
choice are pies, cakes, donuts, muffins, protein bars, a variety of loaves of bread, and other
goodies. To Your Healthy Bakery also provides savory baked goods such as pretzels, casseroles,
lasagnas, moussaka, and spanakopita. Beverage options are also available in-store: the beverages
include smoothies, coffee options, and hot tea.

## History

Anna's baking story began when she was eight years old, and her
little brother was diagnosed with an overabundance of food allergies. In the efforts to provide
him with nutritious food, she began experimenting with baked goods that did not include dairy,
eggs, wheat, meat, corn, soy, nuts, yeast, and half of all fruits and vegetables as the ingredients.
Before opening her storefront in Winston-Salem, Anna baked from her home, for orders she
received from a Facebook page dedicated to her business To Your Health Bakery. After attended
a two-year culinary program at WS/FC Career Center as well as working in local restaurants, she
was able to bake for Great Day Bakery, where she had the freedom to bake and develop her
unique creations of pastries, while attending High Point University. She has won awards for her
baked goods and has appeared on National Televised competitions such as Cupcake Wars, in
2013 and 2019 Hallmark’s Christmas Cookie Matchup.

However, her baking ambitions do not stop at creating yummy gluten-free and vegan
treats for competition or filling cake orders in her kitchen. In December of 2017, Anna’s dream
of opening her Bakery became a reality. In doing so, she is providing her customers with a
gluten and soy-free facility, meeting the highest standards in cleanliness to avoid any cross-contamination.

## Description of Need

Currently, To Your Health Bakery is using a paper trail to manage their daily customer
pick-up and delivery orders. This bakery also does not have any documentation that is provided
to the customer after placing their customer orders. The lack of order documentation has resulted
in business difficulties, including customers receiving improper orders or missing the delivery
pick-up time. Secondly, To Your Health Bakery uses a third party to complete their payment
transactions. This third-party collects the customers' email and phone number to place into the
payment system for future reference; however, To Your Health Bakery is not provided this
information from the third party, which then impacts the companies ability to market and
outreach to their clients.

## Description of Project

We are designing a system that will allow To Your Health Bakery to print daily reports
detailing the day's baking schedule. This report will provide each product, gathered customer
information at the time of order, and its determined order due date. If the products are to be
delivered or part of a special order, the report will indicate that as well. Our goal is to eliminate
the multiple times they are recording their baking schedule in multiple places, by providing a
system where they can enter in the customer information and special indicators regarding the
orders. Being able to print their baking schedule with all pertinent information will save them
time and effort while eliminating concern over misplaced orders.

# PROJECT CHARTER
2/27/2020

## Project Name: Cake Order and Baking Schedule Tracking System

## Project Purpose

To Provide _To Your Health Bakery_ with a front-end application that will track customer's custom cake orders and special orders while also

creating a back-end system to provide the company bakers with a report of what orders are required and when each order is due. This system

will also send the customer a confirmation email with order details and retain a digital copy for the company. The database will help this

company maintain its customer’s order information for their anticipated repeat business. This project will also include an update to _To Your_

_Health Bakery’s_ live website: an online form for the ‘Wedding Tasting Box’ options the company provides.

# SYSTEM SCOPE
2/27 /20 20

## Project Name: Cake Order and Baking Schedule System

Jacob, Joseph, Ann, Ciara

## Problem Description

To Your Health Bakery’s current cake order and baking schedule, tracking systems are completed with pen and paper, which leads to
multiple paper copies of each order being placed in various locations at various times throughout the business day. The current system has
impacted the company in a decrease in revenue due to incorrect or misplaced orders. The process of searching for past orders is a
prolonging event for their past orders are kept in a book. The current customer acquisition is low due to the company’s lack of ability to
retain customer's information with their current system.

## Anticipated Business Benefits

The primary benefit to be obtained from our new system is for To Your Health Bakery to be able to maintain customer order data to
provide proper orders and remove the risk of a decrease in revenue. More immediate benefits include the following:

- Reduce errors caused by manual processing of orders
- Expedite order fulfillment due to order automation
- Increase turn over by tracking sales of popular items and slow-moving items
- Increase in customer acquisition due to retaining customer information for marketing purposes
- Ability to search for previous requests and orders promptly
- Reduce staffing levels for in-store order processing

## System Capabilities

To obtain the benefits listed prior, the current cake order and baking schedule tracking system shall include the following capabilities:

- Diverse accessibility from any device that is a web browser platform(Android, iOS, tablets, computers)
- Direct interface with the database for searching, editing or deleting
- Maintaining previous order history up to two years
- The ability to relate the customer’s order date to the pick-up date
- API for future mobile integration
